Emotion Detection on Social Media


## Description

* Built a system that detects emotion using CNN - BiLSTM classifier model. The application uses messages on social media platform to train the model and absorb emotion from the context. 

*  The system is combined with a web interface - WhatsApp Clone.


## Working

* At first the Dataset is loaded into the system. Then the data in the dataset is pre- processed as in all the stop words as well as punctuations are removed, etc.
* After this the dataset is trained and tested. After testing the dataset the CNN-BiLSTM combined model is trained.
* Once the model is build it is then evaluated. After getting a good accuracy, the model is used.
* Text message received is given as an input to the system and the predicted output is displayed as an emoji after we click on the message received.
